A couple of folders containing your original code: Jess, Juno, Mandy, Slanger.

I have categrized the codes into three main categories:

1. Consistency_check - some useful program to check the consistency of your mass model
2. widgets - useful programs to manipulate your data
3. WSLAP_related - codes that add extra feature to WSLAP

All additional data files are contained in the /supp_files

Jess if you have time please add some description of your codes

Juno I am not quite sure about the function of your codes...if you have time please help me to categorize it?
